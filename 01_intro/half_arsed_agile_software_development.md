#Manifesto for Half-Arsed Agile Software Development

We have heard about new ways of developing software by paying consultants and reading Gartner reports. Through this we have been told to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

  and we have mandatory processes and tools to control how those individuals (we prefer the term ‘resources’) interact

Working software over comprehensive documentation

  as long as that software is comprehensively documented

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

  within the boundaries of strict contracts, of course, and subject to rigorous change control

Responding to change over following a plan

  provided a detailed plan is in place to respond to the change, and it is followed precisely

That is, while the items on the left sound nice
in theory, we’re an enterprise company, and there’s
no way we’re letting go of the items on the right.
